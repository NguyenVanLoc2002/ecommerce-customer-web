# API Common — Shared Conventions

> **Generated from source code on 2026-04-19. Do not edit manually — regenerate when code changes.**

---

## 1. Base URL

```
/api/v1
```

All endpoints are prefixed with `/api/v1`. Breaking changes require a new version (`/api/v2`).

**Local dev:**
```
http://localhost:8080/api/v1
```

**Swagger UI:**
```
http://localhost:8080/swagger-ui.html
```

---

## 2. Authentication

### Mechanism
Bearer JWT — stateless. All protected endpoints require:

```
Authorization: Bearer <access_token>
```

### Token Types

| Token | Lifetime (default) | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| Access token | 1 hour (3 600 000 ms) | Authenticate every API request |
| Refresh token | 7 days (604 800 000 ms) | Obtain a new token pair |

- Access tokens carry `sub` (email) + `roles` claims.
- Refresh tokens carry only `sub`. They cannot be used as access tokens (rejected at filter level).
- After logout, the access token is added to a **Redis blacklist** with TTL = remaining lifetime. Blacklisted tokens are rejected by the filter.

### Token Lifecycle Flow

```
POST /auth/register  ──► { accessToken, refreshToken }
POST /auth/login     ──► { accessToken, refreshToken }

GET /protected       ──► Authorization: Bearer <accessToken>

POST /auth/refresh-token  body: { refreshToken } ──► { accessToken, refreshToken }

POST /auth/logout    ──► Authorization: Bearer <accessToken>  (blacklists access token)
```
